I am a full Stack developer with awesome web technical skills and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment,am looking to create world-class web apps of HIGH STANDARD & TOP QUALITY. I've started my coding journey in summer 2013. For years I've had an active interest in the web and modern technology. Being fascinated with its continuous fast progress I set myself for a challenge to become a Web Developer. I enjoy the process of building the web products from scratch.
